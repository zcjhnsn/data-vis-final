Say stuff about the heat map and how as you navigate through the page you can drill down into the specifics of the trends

## Code Analysis

### TreeMap Class-
<p>
    The treemap class utilizes two D3 libraries, d3.nest and d3.treemap.  The first library gets the data into a nested structure that the treemap library can then read from and have a sense of hierarchy.</p>

### Map Class-
<p>
    The map class utilizes d3.geoAlbersUsa for the map projection.  We also found an example of drawing a similar map at <a href= "https://bl.ocks.org/adamjanes/6cf85a4fd79e122695ebde7d41fe327f">https://bl.ocks.org/adamjanes</a> this was adapted to work for our needs.
</p>

### Parallel Sets Class-
<p>
    <p style="color:red;">Zac fill in...</p>
</p>

### ToolTip Class-
<p>
    We came across most of the code for a tool tip in a git repo. We were then able to modify it for our needs.
